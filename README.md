- 👋 Hi, I’m Katherine!
- 👀 I’m interested in everything wastewater, including wastewater based epidemiology (WBE).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about direct potable reuse; turning wastewater into water you can drink — because every drop counts!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny applications, QMRA (Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment), or anything cool & exciting!
- 📫 How to reach me: katherine.crank@snwa.com
