- 👋 Hi, I’m @kcrank1
- 👀 I’m interested in wastewater based epidemiology, pathogens in wastewater, and the probability of getting sick from interacting with wastewater.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning direct potable reuse, which involves closing the water loop by using wastewater as drinking water (with treatment, of course!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny applications, QMRA (Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment), or anything cool & exciting!
- 📫 How to reach me: katherine.crank@snwa.com
